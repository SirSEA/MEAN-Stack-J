# MEAN Stack Learning Journey ðŸš€
Welcome to my learning journey towards becoming a MEAN Stack Developer! This repository will serve as a log for my progress as I dedicate myself to mastering the MEAN stack over the next month.

# What is the MEAN Stack?
The MEAN stack is a powerful full-stack JavaScript framework made up of:
MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store application data
Express.js: Backend web framework that runs on top of Node.js
Angular: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications
Node.js: JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server
Together, these technologies allow for the creation of scalable, efficient, and powerful web applications using a single language (JavaScript) from frontend to backend.

# Learning Goals
# My objective is to:
Build a solid foundation in JavaScript (ES6+)
Master backend development using Node.js and Express
Understand and implement MongoDB for database management
Build dynamic user interfaces using Angular
Integrate all parts into full-stack applications

# Learning Schedule
I am dedicating 4-5 hours daily over the course of a month to:
Week 1: JavaScript fundamentals, Node.js introduction
Week 2: MongoDB, Express.js basics
Week 3: Angular basics and integration
Week 4: Full stack project and advanced features
Each week will end with a test project to solidify the concepts learned.

# Test Projects
Each week, Iâ€™ll document test projects that apply what I've learned. You can find my weekly projects in the projects/ directory:
 # Week 1 Project: JavaScript-focused task on array manipulation and sorting.

# How to Use This Repo
Feel free to clone this repo and follow along with the steps. If you're also learning, you might find the resources here helpful:
